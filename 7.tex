If we can separate a two-proton state into a product of the state of photon 1 and the state of photon 2, then the state is \textbf{not} entangled.

Mathematically, a state in the form $a|VV\rangle + b|VH\rangle + c|HV\rangle + d|HH\rangle$ is not entangled if $ad-bc=0$ (as outlined in 2013 solutions).

$|A\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big( |HH\rangle - |HV\rangle \big)$ can be factorized as $|A\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |H\rangle_1 \big( |H\rangle_1 + |V\rangle_2 \big)$, thus it is not entangled (alternatively, $a=b=0$, thus $ad-bc=0$).

$|B\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big( |VH\rangle - |HV\rangle \big)$ has $a=d=0$, $b=1$, $c=-1$, thus $ad-bc \neq 0$, and it is entangled.

$|C\rangle = \frac{1}{2} \big( -|VV\rangle - |VH\rangle + |HV\rangle + |HH\rangle \big)$ has $a=b=-1$ and $c=d=1$, thus $ad-bc = 0$ and it is not entangled.

Explicitly, $|C\rangle = \frac{1}{2} \big( -|V\rangle_1 + |H\rangle_1 \big) \big( |V\rangle_2 + |H\rangle_2 \big)$.
