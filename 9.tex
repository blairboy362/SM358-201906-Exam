\subsection{}

The formal bond order of a molecule is

\begin{align*}
  FBO = \frac{n_b - n_a}{2}
\end{align*}

where $n_b$ is the number of bonding electrons, and $n_a$ the number of antibonding electrons.

Using the given bonding and antibonding orbitals, we can find that $n_b = 10$ and $n_a = 6$, giving

\begin{align*}
  FBO = \frac{10-6}{2} = 2,
\end{align*}

i.e. the formal bonding order of the molecule is 2.

\subsection{}

The highest orbital ($1\pi_g$) of the molecule is not full -- it only contains two electrons out of the possible four ($\pi$ orbitals are doubly degenerate).
